# Log Analyzer (Java Project)

## 📌 Overview

The tool helps in quickly finding errors, warnings, and activity trends from long log files.

## 🎯 Features (Planned)
- Read log files line by line
- Parse log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR, etc.)
- Count total lines, errors, and warnings
- Show most common error messages
- Identify peak activity hours

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Java (Core concepts: OOP, File I/O, Collections)
- Git & GitHub for version control
